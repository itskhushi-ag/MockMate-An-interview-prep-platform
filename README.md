🚀MOCKMATE- Interview Preparation Platform (MERN)
📌 Project Overview

Interview preparation is a critical phase for students and job seekers, yet most available 
platforms are either paid or fragmented, leaving candidates without structured guidance. 
MockMate – MERN-based Interview Preparation Platform addresses this gap by providing a 
centralized, user-friendly, and free solution for comprehensive interview practice. The 
platform allows users to explore categorized question banks, simulate mock interviews, track 
progress through analytics, and engage in peer discussions. With features like resume upload, 
bookmarking, and gamification, it not only enhances technical preparation but also builds 
overall confidence. Built on a scalable MERN architecture, MockMate ensures seamless user 
experience, secure authentication, and efficient data management. Its extensibility further 
allows integration of AI/NLP in the future, making it a modern, practical, and impactful 
project. This significance lies in empowering candidates to prepare effectively and improve 
employability in a competitive job market.
